        Welcome to the Virtual Online Pet Cemetery, a place where memories live forever.
        We provide a dedicated space for pet owners to honor, remember, and share the
        stories of their beloved companions.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Our mission is to make it easier to say goodbye by offering heartfelt tributes,
        online memorials, and optional virtual funeral services. Whether your pet was
        with you for months or decades, their memory deserves a special place.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        This is more than just a website — it’s a community of pet lovers who understand
        the bond you shared. Here, every wag, purr, chirp, or nuzzle is remembered.
